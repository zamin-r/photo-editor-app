Test function for the invert filter in simple_Cimpl_filters.

"""This file shows one way to unit test an image-processing filter.
The test function creates two small images. The first is the 'original' image
that is passed to the filter. The second is identical to the transformed image
that we expect the filter to return. The colours in the expected image weren't
obtained by passing 'original' to the filter - what if the filter has a bug?
Instead, they were calculated 'by hand', based on the filter's specification.

def check_equal(description: str, outcome, expected) -> None:
    """
    Print a "passed" message if outcome and expected have same type and
    are equal (as determined by the == operator); otherwise, print a 
    "fail" message.

    Parameter description should provide information that will help us
    interpret the test results; e.g., the call expression that yields
    outcome.

    Parameters outcome and expected are typically the actual value returned
    by a call expression and the value we expect a correct implementation
    of the function to return, respectively. Both parameters must have the same
    type, which must be a type for which == is used to determine if two values
    are equal. Don't use this function to check if floats, lists of floats,
    tuples of floats, etc. are equal.
